                  <p>
                    Welcome to our website dedicated to saving and helping stray dogs in Sri Lanka. We are a passionate group of individuals committed to making a positive impact on the lives of these vulnerable animals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sri Lanka has a street dog population that has been estimated to be between one and two million. Every day hundreds of puppies are born on the streets; many do not survive. Uncaring pet owners add to rising numbers by dumping their unwanted, sick or injured pets on the streets or in public places.

These dogs are not ‘street-wise’, without the knowledge to find food and shelter, most meet a prolonged and painful end.

Embark was created by Otara Gunewardene with the purpose of improving the lives of Sri Lanka’s street dogs. Building on eight tireless years of work, there is a still more than can be done for these street dogs. Several other welfare organizations have also joined the fight to save these animals but such efforts need to be supported with input from the Sri Lankan people, each doing their share to give the street dogs a better life.

Embark’s education and awareness programmes are designed to educate children and adults on important issues like dog-bite and Rabies prevention, while spreading awareness on topics relating to animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.  Embark also goes to great lengths to inspire kindness and compassion towards animals and to uplift the image of the street dog in the eyes of the public.

                Welcome to our website dedicated to saving and helping stray dogs in Sri Lanka. We are a passionate group of individuals committed to making a positive impact on the lives of these vulnerable animals.

                Do you love dogs as much as we do? We need your help in Sri Lanka on our new street dog initiative that aims to help protect and care for man’s best friend and to improve the animal-human relationship within the local community.

Being a dog in Sri Lanka is a hard life and one of the things you will notice when you first arrive onto the island is just how many strays there are wandering the beaches and streets – upwards of 3 million in total! The lack of food, shelter and care drastically reduces the lifespan of a street dog and with the rising prevalence of rabies, the future unfortunately does not look good for most.

We urgently need volunteers like you to help monitor, take care of and feed all of the street dogs that have currently been identified in the local area. You will contribute to a long term and sustainable programme that aims to reduce the number of streets dogs within the local village and then further afield through sterilisation campaigns, education and re-homing initiatives.- <Source:media>themightyroar.com</Source:media>

              <p>Our project is a unique facility for street animals in Sri Lanka. We have a beautiful, free-roaming sanctuary for dogs and secure sanctuary for cats in the south of Sri Lanka which provides a safe-haven for sick, disabled and vulnerable strays.

                We have an on-site veterinary clinic with resident local vets & are operational every day of the year providing life-saving treatment and care. We also operate neutering/rabies vaccination programmes in the local area, adoption schemes and animal welfare education.       </p>

Born into a world of uncertainty, she navigated the concrete jungle, her petite paws carrying her through each passing day. With her endearing wrinkled face and expressive eyes, Tina captured the attention of those who crossed her path.

                        As a young pup, Tina found herself abandoned, left to fend for herself in a world that seemed indifferent. Her days were filled with endless wandering, seeking shelter under the cold shadows of buildings, and surviving on scraps she discovered along her path. Her heart ached for warmth, for the touch of a caring hand, and for a sense of belonging.
                        
                        Tina's resilience shone through the darkest of times. She endured the harsh elements, the constant pangs of hunger, and the loneliness that enveloped her. Yet, her spirit remained unbroken, her tail wagging with unwavering optimism. Tina's playful nature and gentle demeanor offered solace to those who met her, briefly lifting their burdens and reminding them of the power of unconditional love.

                  <p>In the vast countryside, a tiny creature named Kuki embarked on a remarkable journey of survival and resilience. Born into a world of uncertainty, she was separated from her canine family at a tender age, left to navigate the world on her own. With her innocent eyes and wagging tail, Kuki faced each day with unwavering courage.

                    From the moment her paws touched the earth, Kuki embraced the wonders and challenges of the wild. She frolicked through meadows, chased butterflies with glee, and listened to the whispers of the wind. Yet, amidst the beauty of nature, Kuki yearned for something more—companionship, a loving touch, and the security of a forever home.
                    
                    As Kuki roamed the countryside, she encountered various obstacles and dangers. Harsh weather, hunger, and the constant search for shelter became her daily battles. But through it all, she held onto a glimmer of hope, believing that there was someone out there who would recognize her spirit and offer her the love she so deserved.

With every wag of her tail and gentle nuzzle, Kuki reminded those she encountered of the power of resilience and the unconditional love that only a canine companion could offer.

Her brave heart longs for a place to call home, a place where she can share her boundless energy, affectionate kisses, and unwavering loyalty. Will you be the one to open your heart and give Kuki the love and care she so eagerly awaits?
